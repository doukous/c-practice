# The equivalent expressions :

- += is an assignment operator, it evaluates an expression and assign it to the given L-value. The priority is the assignment of the expression, not its rendering

- ++i is prefix which means it first increment and after yields i
- i++ is postfix which means it first yields i and only after increments i

- so ++i is the one that correspond to i += 1, as it priors the evaluation and assignment
